## Basic scraper for DGT test results

Right now just capable of checking if error message is displayed (i.e. when results are not published yet)

When having access to a succesful result, code may be extended.


### Files to be provided
All info could be provided from the browser console when accessing via web (recommended way).

1. `body.txt` Text content
2. `headers.txt` Text content in raw format. Code is capable of converting it to a dictionary.
